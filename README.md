# NewsApp
As part of my ongoing internship, I recently completed my second projectâ€”a news app that displays news articles in a list view. This project was a fantastic opportunity to demonstrate my coding skills and implement modern development practices under real-world conditions.

Here are some key highlights of the project:

ðŸ›  Tech Stack & Tools:

Retrofit2: For seamless API integration.
Jetpack Compose with Kotlin: To create a modern, responsive UI.
Dagger Hilt: For dependency injection, improving code modularity and testability.
Clean Architecture: Ensuring a robust, maintainable, and testable codebase.
ðŸ“± Features:

Displaying news articles in an intuitive list view.
Utilizing modern design patterns and best practices.
Focused on performance and user experience.
This project, assigned by my company, has been an incredible learning experience, allowing me to deepen my understanding of clean architecture, dependency injection with Dagger Hilt, and modern Android development with Jetpack Compose. I'm grateful for the opportunity and excited to continue leveraging these skills in future projects.
